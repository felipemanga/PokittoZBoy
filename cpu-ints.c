 * Provides defines to handle interrupts.
 *
 * Note: When an interrupt condition is met (for ex. VBLANK, or TIMA overflow, etc), then the hardware
 *       checks whether the interrupt for this condition is ENABLED or not, by looking into the IE
 *       register. If the interrupt is ENABLED, then it gets REQUESTED, by setting the same flag in
 *       the IF register.
 *       However, the interrupt will be HANDLED only when/if the IME is enabled. Once the interrupt
 *       is HANDLED (ie. PC is set to proper vector), the interrupt is ACKNOWLEDGED (reset the flag of
 *       the IF register).
