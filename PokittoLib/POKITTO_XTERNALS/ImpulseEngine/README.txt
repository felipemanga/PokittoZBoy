Impulse Engine
Created by Randy Gaul

Impulse Engine is a small 2D physics engine written in C++. The engine is intended to be used in an educational manner by other looking to learn the inner workings of physics engines.

Should build in Windows with Visual Studio 2008-2012. Should build on Linux and OSX platforms with the use of C++11 std::chrono. Thanks to whackashoe for the cross-platform port.
